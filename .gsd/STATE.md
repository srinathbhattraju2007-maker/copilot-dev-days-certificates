## Accumulated Context

### Decisions
- Stack: Single `index.html`, pure HTML/CSS/Vanilla JS (ES6+), no build pipeline
- CDN libs: qrcode.js v1.0.0, html2pdf.js v0.10.1, Google Fonts (Playfair Display + Lato)
- Hosting: GitHub Pages (static, zero backend)
- Certificate ID convention: email sanitization — `jane.doe@gmail.com` → `jane-doe-at-gmail-com`
- Clean URL paths (e.g. `/john-doe`) explicitly out of scope — conflicts with OG scraper requirement
- v2 deferral: CI validator, certificate gallery, multiple workshops per person, opaque IDs, sitemap

- SRI hashes fetched live from cdnjs API at execution time (qrcode.min.js, html2pdf.bundle.min.js)
- loading-view has no hidden class — visible by default for app init
- Error message hardcoded in HTML — branding config fetch may itself have failed
